# Your Technology Your Way: Full-stack Web and Service with .NET and Node

These code samples compliment the presentation at https://robrich.org/slides/your-technology-your-way/#/

There are two samples:

- C#: an app built with Blazor (client-side), ASP.NET Core REST apis, Worker Service, and gRPC
- Node: an app built with Vue.js, Express, a Node service hosted in PM2, and gRPC

You can mix-and-match these pieces to build an app your way.
